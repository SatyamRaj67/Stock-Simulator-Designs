## 🧐 Overview

Welcome to the **Stock Simulator**! A safe haven for students, professionals, and that one uncle who thinks he's the Wolf of Wall Street. This platform lets you learn the chaotic art of Stock Trading using entirely fake currency.

Simulate the highs of a bull market and the lows of a crash, all while your real bank account stays perfectly safe.

## 💡 Inspiration

Let's be real: Financial literacy in India (and the world) is... _lacking_.
Most people treat the stock market like a casino. They dive in with life savings, follow a "tip" from a random WhatsApp group, and end up losing everything.

I built this project to fix that.

> **Goal:** Make mistakes here, so you don't make them out there. 📉 -> 📈

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (The "Satyam Special")

We are keeping it **fresh, fast, and strict**. No spaghetti code allowed.

| Category         | Tool                        | Why?                                           |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Framework**    | **Next.js 15 (App Router)** | Because we live on the bleeding edge.          |
| **Language**     | **TypeScript**              | Bugs are scary; types are safe.                |
| **Backend / DB** | **Convex**                  | Real-time updates faster than market rumors.   |
| **Auth**         | **Better Auth**             | Secure, simple, and no headaches.              |
| **Styling**      | **Tailwind CSS**            | Writing CSS in 2024? No thanks.                |
| **UI Kit**       | **shadcn/ui**               | It looks expensive, but it's free.             |
| **Charts**       | **Recharts**                | For those beautiful green candles.             |
| **Tables**       | **TanStack Table**          | Sorting/Filtering like a pro terminal.         |
| **Forms**        | **React Hook Form + Zod**   | Validation is key.                             |
| **Testing**      | **Jest**                    | Because "it works on my machine" isn't enough. |
